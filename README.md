# uee.life
Welcome to the code for UEE.life, the portal to your life in the UEE!

This is a passion project, and contribution to the Star Citizen community, while also being an opportunity to learn nodejs, vue and nuxt. As this is a learning process, much of the code needs a lot of work, but it's getting there!

If you have any feature ideas, or bugs to file, please feel free to do so! I'll get to it all as I can.

Thanks, and fly safe. I'll see you in the 'verse!
